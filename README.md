Learn to make iOS Apps with [The App Brewery](https://www.appbrewery.co) ðŸ“± | Project Stub | (Swift 4.0/Xcode 9) - Clima App

This app project was a starting point that allowed me to write my own functionality using the following concepts:
* Alamofire library imported via Cocoapods
* Codable functionality in Swift 4
* Passing data back to a previous ViewController using protocols and delegates
* Working with closures
* Using the model, view, controller paradigm
* Accessing an API with the help of its own documentation
